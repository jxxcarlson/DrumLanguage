    """This app turns text into a kind of techno-music by imitating
the princples of African drum languages.  Things to try: (1) put text
in this box and press "Play".  (2) Alter the tempo (beats per minute).
(3) Try patterns, e.g., "Wawachaachaadadadada,,"  Here spaces and
commas both give one beat rests. (4) It is fun to experiment with
patterns like palindromes: What is si tahW is si sii sii,,,,
repetition, etc.

initialTextVoice2 =
    """Note that there are two voices.  The first (above) is playing
in quarter notes, while the second (here) is playing in eight notes.

To my ear, Sample 2 is the most interesting.  Note that the two
parts have lengths 36 and 11, in quarter and eight notes, respectively.
Counted in eighth notes, the lengths are 72 and 11.  Thus the song
repeats itself every 72 x 11 = 792 beats.
